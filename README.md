# Canvas Game Engine

## A 2D tile-based platform/shooter written in HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JS

## Building

In the root of this directory, run `npm install && npx webpack`.  Then double-click on the `dist/index.html` file to run in your browser of choice.

## Features
- Pure ES6 / HTML5 Canvas
- Use of Javascript Modules for concern separation
- Webpack is used to build a single `main.js` file, however due to vanilla Module usage, it is not strictly necessary.
    - For further information about native Javascript Module support, please see this [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
